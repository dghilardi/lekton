# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains the ADrs for Lekton. An ADR is a document that captures a significant architectural decision made in the project, along with its context and consequences.

## Record Format

Each ADR should follow this template:

```markdown
# ADR [Number]: [Title]

## Status
[Draft | Proposed | Accepted | Superseded]

## Context
What is the problem? What are the constraints?

## Decision
What is the chosen solution?

## Consequences
What are the pros/cons? What is the impact on other components?
```
